# Street-Lights-in-Logo-Soft-Comfort
This project is a copy of the program that runs lights at one of the intersections in Rybnik - Poland.

I've made this project to try how difficult it is to programm intesection lights. I've been sitting on that intersection for the whole weekend trying to reproduce exact algorithm that was used on the intersection of Jana Kotucza and Raciborska street in Rybniik.
I've used stopwatches and notebooks to note all the possible situations from each perspective. I've probably crossed the zebra crossings hundreds of times and used my car to drive through that intersection tens of times.

After it was finished I made some modifications because I though that some of the things that were implemented were not efficient enough.
Now it has everything including:
- Lights for cars to go forward or to turn (with conditional turn lights),
- Pedestrian crossings
- Different mode after between 10pm and 6am

Unfortunattely those lights are of a old date so they don't have sensors that know when the car comes, so I didn't implement that in this project.

Note: This program is not used on this intersection, it is just a "fan made" copy of that
